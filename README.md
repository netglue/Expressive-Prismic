# WIP: Zend Expressive / Prismic.io CMS Module

## Introduction

This module/library's purpose is to ease development of content driven websites using prismic.io's content API as a backend service.

If you haven't heard of Prismic before, you can [find out about it here](https://prismic.io). 



### Document Meta

Assuming you're using Prismic to make web pages, you'll likely be setting various on-page SEO elements using the CMS as well as OpenGraph data, Twitter Cards, Structured Data perhaps too.

There are a few Opt-In tools to automate this process for you, but currently they are mostly coupled to `Zend\View`
